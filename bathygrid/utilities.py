def bin2d_with_indices(x: np.array, y: np.array, x_edges: np.array, y_edges: np.array):

    Started out using scipy binned_statistic_2d, but I found that it would append bins regardless of the number of bins
    you ask for (even when all points are inside the explicit bin edges) and the binnumber would be difficult to
    translate.  Since our bin edges are always sorted, a 2d binning isn't really that hard, so we do it using
    searchsorted for speed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        x coordinate of the points, should be same shape as y (one dimensional)
    y
        y coordinate of the points, should be same shape as x (one dimensional)
    x_edges
        the bounds for the bins in the x dimension, should be one larger than the total expected bins in this dimension
    y_edges
        the bounds for the bins in the y dimension, should be one larger than the total expected bins in this dimension

    Returns
    -------
    np.array
        one dimensional integer index array that indicates which bin each point falls within.  Applies to the flattened
        bins (is a one dimensional index)
